Ocean Ecommerce Sales Dashboard
Goal of the Project:
The goal of this Power BI dashboard project is to create an interactive and visually compelling tool that enables stakeholders to gain critical insights into sales performance. By tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales amount, profit, quantity sold, and average order value (AOV), the dashboard aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making. The dashboard will also provide detailed breakdowns of sales by state, customer, product category, and payment mode, allowing users to dynamically filter data by quarter and state.

Understanding Requirements:
Begin by clearly defining the project's objectives and understanding the specific business questions the dashboard aims to answer.

Data Collection:
Gather all relevant data, including sales transactions, customer information, product categories, payment modes, and geographic details.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies, duplicates, or missing values.
Standardize formats and create any necessary calculated fields, such as AOV (Average Order Value).

Data Modeling:
Create relationships between tables to ensure accurate data linking.
Define the key metrics (KPIs) such as sum of amount, profit, quantity, and AOV.

Designing Visualizations:
Select the appropriate visualizations to represent the data effectively:
Bar Chart: Sum of amount by state.

Donut Chart: Sum of quantity by category and payment mode.
Column Chart: Sum of amount by customer name and profit by month.
Bar Chart: Sum of profit by sub-category.

Implementing Filters and Slicers:
Add slicers for quarter and state to allow users to filter the data dynamically.
Ensure that the slicers interact with all the visualizations appropriately.

Dashboard Development:
Arrange the visualizations in a user-friendly layout.
Ensure the dashboard is intuitive and provides clear insights at a glance.

Testing and Validation:
Test the dashboard to ensure that all visualizations are functioning as expected.
Validate the data and calculations against the original source to ensure accuracy.

User Feedback and Iteration:
Share the dashboard with stakeholders for feedback.
Make necessary adjustments based on user input to enhance usability and relevance.

Finalization and Deployment:
Finalize the dashboard layout and features.
Deploy the dashboard, ensuring it is accessible to the intended audience.
